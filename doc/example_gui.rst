GUI user guide
==============

The ``OXASL_OPTPCASL`` GUI is started using the command ``oxasl_optpcasl_gui``

GUI requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The wxpython GUI library is required for the GUI. This is not included as a requirements of ``oxasl_optpcasl``
since it is possible to use the optimizer solely through the command line. So, if you want to use the
GUI you will need to install ``wxpython``, for example using one of the following::

    python -m pip install wxpython
    conda install wxpython
    
.. info::
    ``fslpython``, the Conda environment included in FSL, has ``wxpython`` already installed
    so you don't need either of these if you are using FSL python.
    
GUI errors on Mac
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A common issue on Mac when a Conda environment is being used is that the GUI will fail to start
with a message about requiring a 'Framework Build'.

This is a well known issue with Conda which to date has not been fixed. To work around the problem
you need to modify the wrapper script, for example using::

    nano `which oxasl_optpcasl_gui`

If you are using FSL and installed `oxasl_optpcasl` into `fslpython` then change the first line to:

    #!/usr/bin/env fslpythonw
    
Otherwise, change the first line to::

    #!/usr/bin/env pythonw
    
This should enable to the script to run.

Overview of the GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The window is divided into two horizontally. The left hand pane is used to
set properties of the scan protocol, assumed physiological parameters and options
for the optimization process. The right hand pane displays characteristics of the
selected protocol including sensitivity to ATT and CBF and illustrations of the
relationship between the effective PLDs of the protocol and the PCASL kinetic
curve (using the Buxton model).

Setting the scan parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the first tab we set the parameters for the scan we want to optimize.
There are three basic scan protocols:

PCASL protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This protocol is a standard PCASL acquisition which consists of an inversion
(labelling) pulse followed by a post-labelling delay (PLD) followed by readout. 
This cycle is then repeated but without the labelling pulse, substituting a 
matching control delay so the total time to readout is the same. For a single
PLD this can be depicted graphically as follows:

.. image:: /images/gui/pcasl_spld.png
    :alt: PCASL single PLD experiment

Subtraction of the labelled image from the control image is used to obtain the 
ASL signal.

This label/control cycle can be repeated with different PLDs in order to sample 
the ASL kinetic curve at different points. The different PLDs may be paired
with the same labelling duration (LD) or each PLD may have a different LD:

.. image:: /images/gui/pcasl_mpld.png
    :alt: PCASL multi PLD experiment with single LD

.. image:: /images/gui/pcasl_mpld_mld.png
    :alt: PCASL multi PLD experiment with multiple LDs

When using a PCASL protocol the initial PLDs must be specified as a space or comma 
separated list of values in seconds. The labelling duration may either be
fixed (one value which is not optimized), single (one initial value which is optimized)
or multiple (one initial value per PLD, all optimized).

    :alt: PCASL multi PLD experiment with single variable LD

.. image:: /images/gui/pcasl_opts_mld.png
    :alt: PCASL multi PLD experiment with multiple variable LDs

Hadamard time-encoded protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this protocol, the labelling phase consists of a *sequence* of 'sub-boli' 
each of which may be either an inversion pulse or
a control delay. After the full set of sub-boli there is again a post-labelling
delay followed by readout. The cycle is repeated but with the label/control
allocation of each sub-bolus changed for each repeat. The pattern of these
label/control sub-boli across all the acquisition cycles forms a Hadamard
matrix. Sizes of 4, 8 and 12 may be used (the number of sub-boli is one less
than the matrix size). For example a Hadamard acquisition using a matrix of size
8 can be depicted as follows:

.. image:: /images/gui/had.png
    :alt: Hadamard acquisition
    
To obtain the ASL signal the images must be decoded by adding and subtracting
each cycle. By doing this in different ways the contribution of each sub-bolus
can be isolated without the need for a corresponding control cycle. Hence 
Hadamard encoding allows us to obtain 7 subtracted images from only 8 label/control
cycles (conventional PCASL would require 14 label/control cycles to produce
7 subtracted images). We can therefore potentially extract more information 
in a given time.

Commonly Hadamard protocols only use a single PLD since each sub-bolus has a 
different effective PLD when decoded. However it is possible to repeat the entire 
Hadamard sequence at multiple PLDs, for example this acquisition (using a 
matrix size of 4 to reduce the time required):

.. image:: /images/gui/had_mpld.png
    :alt: Hadamard acquisition

The lengths of the Hadamard sub-boli may all be equal, however do not have to be. 
Once approach is to choose the length of the first sub-bolus and then choose
shorter lengths for the remainder to account for T1 decay in such 
a way that the total signal from each sub-bolus is the same:

.. image:: /images/gui/had_t1decay.png
    :alt: Hadamard acquisition

Alternatively, all the sub-boli durations may be specified (and optimized) 
independently.

With the Hadamard protocol, the matrix size must be specified and the strategy
for choosing sub-bolus durations. If these are all equal then a single initial value 
must be given. When using the T1 decay strategy the first sub-bolus duration 
is specified. When sub-bolus durations are unconstrained the initial values
must be specified as space or comma separated values in seconds
(one less than the matrix size):

.. image:: /images/gui/had_opts_equal.png
    :alt: Hadamard experiment with equal sub-bolus durations
    
.. image:: /images/gui/had_opts_multiple.png
    :alt: Hadamard experiment with unconstrained sub-bolus durations

'Free lunch' protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is essentially a Hadamard protocol, however the first sub-bolus is fixed 
at a 'long' value typically equal to that used in single-PLD PCASL experiments. 
The idea here is to do a 'normal' single delay PCASL experiment but fill in the 
long PLD with additional Hadamard encoded sub-boli. The resulting images can either
be analysed as a collection of 4 single-PLD label/control pairs (the remaining
sub-bolus contributions cancel out in this case), or undergo Hadamard decoding 
to gain additional information 'for free'. Typically we optimize the duration 
of the first of these sub-boli and assign the remainder using the T1 decay 
strategy.

.. image:: /images/gui/freelunch.png
    :alt: Free-lunch acquisition

Note the similarity of this to the single-PLD experiment shown above - they 
are essentially the same but with the 'spare' PLD space filled with time-encoded
labelling pulses for additional information.

With the free-lunch protocol, a single fixed labelling duration must be given - 
this is not optimized. An initial value for the next sub-bolus duration must
also be given, this is optimized and the remainder are chosen according to the
T1 decay strategy. One or more initial PLDs is also required:

.. image:: /images/gui/freelunch_opts.png
    :alt: Hadamard acquisition

Currently it is not possible to change the strategy used to select sub-bolus
durations, nor to optimize the initial 'long' LD. This may be added in the 
future.

2D/3D readout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If we are using a 2D multi-slice readout, additional options for the 
time per slice and number of slices are enabled:

Displaying information about the protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clicking the ``Set Protocol`` button loads the initial protocol design into 
the output tabs on the right side of the viewing pane. Nothing has been
optimized yet, but you can view information about the protocol's sensitivity
to ATT and CBF here.

The protocol summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tab shows a graphical representation of the protocol together with the
calculated cost values for measuring CBF, ATT and combined CBF/ATT cost. The
optimization process will seek to modify the PLDs/LDs of the protocol to 
minimise one of these values.

Sensitivity to CBF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This plot shows the sensitivity of the protocol to CBF at a range of arterial
transit times. For example, in the plot below we can see that this protocol becomes 
less sensitive to CBF at longer ATTs. Sensitivity plots often have 'steps'
in them which generally correspond to the PLDs.

.. image:: /images/gui/cbf_sens.png
    :alt: CBF sensitivity plot

Sensitivity to ATT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This plot similarly shows sensitivity to measurements of ATT.

.. image:: /images/gui/att_sens.png
    :alt: ATT sensitivity plot

Kinetic curve
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tab shows an illustration of the simple Buxton model of the ASL signal with
the protocol PLDs displayed as vertical dashed lines. Note that for time encoded
(Hadamard) protocols, the PLDs shown are the effective PLDs for each sub-bolus
after decoding. The slider at the bottom can be used to view the kinetic curve
at different ATTs.

.. image:: /images/gui/kinetic_curve.png
    :alt: Kinetic curve

In protocols with multiple labelling durations a different
kinetic curve is plotted for each.

.. image:: /images/gui/kinetic_curve_mld.png
    :alt: Kinetic curve at multiple LDs

Optimization configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the 'Optimization' tab, we can control the optimization parameters. This includes
the prior distribution of ATT and the search limits for PLDs. However the
most likely setting to change here is whether we want to optimize for
CBF, ATT or both.

.. image:: /images/gui/optimization_opts.png
    :alt: Setting optimization options
    
The optimization works by modifying one parameter (PLD or LD) at a time and
sometimes can reach different results depending on what order it chooses to
optimize each parameter. To make the results more robust it is common to repeat
the optimization cycle multiple times (the order is chosen randomly each time) 
and choose the outcome with the lowest cost. When optimizing a small number of
parameters (e.g. a single LD and PLD) multiple runs may be unnecessary, however
when multiple PLDs and LDs are to be optimized it may be helpful to run the 
optimization a large number of times - of course this may take a while!

Running the optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click the ``Run Optimization`` button to start - it may take a few seconds for
a simple optimization with a single repeat, or many minutes for cases with 
many parameters or where multiple optimization loops have been specified. Fine
PLD/LD search spacings and large ATT prior distributions may also increase the
time required for optimization.

After optimization, the output pane will be updated to show the optimized 
protocol. The label ``Optimized`` will be shown beside the cost measure that
has been optimized.

Sample output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the output of an optimized multi-PLD PCASL experiment with 3 PLDs
and a single optimized labelling duration.

When optimizing for CBF alone, we get the following scan:

.. image:: /images/gui/example_cbf.png
    :alt: Scan optimized for CBF

.. image:: /images/gui/example_cbf_km.png
    :alt: Kinetic curve for scan optimized for CBF

Note that two of the three PLDs are in the decay part of the curve for most
ATTs (this plot was obtained for ATT=1.3). This is good for estimating
CBF as the whole bolus has usually arrived by this point.

When optimizing for ATT alone, we get the following scan:

.. image:: /images/gui/example_att.png
    :alt: Scan optimized for ATT

.. image:: /images/gui/example_att_km.png
    :alt: Kinetic curve for scan optimized for ATT

As expected, when optimizing for ATT measurements, shorter PLDs are preferred
to sample the inflow of the bolus.

When optimizing for CBF and ATT we obtain the following:

.. image:: /images/gui/example_comb.png
    :alt: Scan optimized for ATT and CBF

.. image:: /images/gui/example_comb_km.png
    :alt: Kinetic curve for scan optimized for ATT and CBF

The combined optimization is in between the CBF and ATT-only
extremes with longer PLDs than the ATT-only optimization but shorter
than the CBF-only case.
